- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Track average steps, goal achievement percentage, streaks, and more.
- **Monthly Calendar View**: Visual calendar showing daily performance with color-coded indicators.
- **Activity Timeline**: Bubble chart displaying steps over time with temperature correlation.
- **Analysis**: Bar charts comparing activity by day of week, temperature range, and location

1. **Filters**: Date range, location, day type, and temperature filters.
2. **KPIs**: 8 key metrics including averages, maximums, and streaks.
3. **Calendar & Timeline**: Monthly calendar and activity timeline.
4. **Comparative Charts**: Three bar charts analyzing patterns.

## Goal Settings
